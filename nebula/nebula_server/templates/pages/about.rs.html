    <p>
      Nebula is a full stack application meant to replicate the mechanics 
      of a Functions-as-a-Service platform. The idea is that users "deploy" 
      the functions they want to run as WebAssembly binaries onto the platform, 
      and then call them with a input and receive an output. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is mainly used as a playground for experimenting with functions 
      run as WebAssembly modules versus the same function (and code) wrapped in 
      a docker image. In order to make a fair assessment, both versions are treated 
      as standalone programs that I feed input as stdin and read the result as 
      stdout. The results will be compiled into findings for my Master Thesis that is 
      due this spring.
